## Election-Audit Summary
The code written in this analysis can be modified for future elections by replacing the election_results source file with new data from a different election, so long as the column headers and format of the CSV file remain the same. The script can be modified for use in other elections by updating the file path of the new election results csv file, and creating a new text file filename and location for the new election analysis.
